  In this post I will explore some of the issues regarding modeling and the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I will focus on the issue
of the assumptions used, and the issues regarding public policy implementation based on the findings of the modeling.
  All information provided in this review is current as of Sunday, April 19th, 2020, and is primarily obtained from 
  healthdata.org (the IHME website), worldometers.com, statista.com, CDC.gov, and reliable news sources.
  One metric that modeling is highly concerned with is attempting to predict a peak in new cases of infection, and also daily fatalities 
  from Covid-19.  An update made on April 13th contained this interesting statement: "The duration of COVID-19 epidemic peaks appears to vary widely across locations 
  (e.g., some experience a sharp peak, while others seem to experience a flatter peak where similar peak daily COVID-19 deaths 
  occur for several days before the epidemic curve declines); this is critical to capture. Further, this development is important 
  because the timing and duration of daily death peaks informs our models on the relationship between peak and social distancing 
  covariates."
  This observation appears to mirror the apparent discrepancies in the ratio of deaths to diagnosed cases.  It also further illuminates
  one of the more difficult parts of the modeling process:  establishing a range for the parameters which the model is based upon.
  
  The parameter which was truly unknown was the ratio of expected deaths to diagnosed cases:  for every 100 people who become ill
  with the Covid-19 disease, how many would die.  Initially it was assumed that 1 to 4 people would not survive, indicating a fatal rate
  of 1%-4%.  A study from 3/31/2020 published in The Lancet reported an estimated fatal rate of 3.67% based on examination of 24 cases in China.  A quick examination of the current data reveals an even wider range of outcomes: of countries reporting over 100K diagnosed
  cases of Covid-19, the range of fatal rates is 3.1% in Germany to 13.2% in Italy.  The U.S., with a dataset over 3X that of any other country,
  is revealing a fatal rate of 5.31%.  This is based on over 750K diagnosed cases.
  
  Which leads to the question:  does the rate of fatalities accurately reflect the true fatal rate of Covid-19, or is the number of 
  undiagnosed cases potentially quite large?  This information is crucial to inform policy makers on future decisions.  If the true fatal
  rate is, for example, 2.65%, the number of undiagnosed cases in the U.S. is approximately 750K.  Depending on the distribution of
  these undiagnosed cases, easing social distancing restrictions could lead to a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.
  
  Additionally, the fatal rate across age groups quite dramatic.  In Italy, 98.7% of all fatalities are persons aged 50 or over.  In the U.S., that number is 94.1%.  This does not, however, reflect the age distribution of all diagnosed cases.
  
  It would appear that continued testing will be crucial to prevent another widespread outbreak.  Urban areas, in particular, appear highly vulnerable to rapid outbreaks of Covid-19 cases.  Transit workers in NYC are showing infection rates higher than first responders/frontline healthcare workers, with over 2200 workers ill and 59 deaths.  In addition, the IHME is utilizing new data from Google and cellphone providers which indicate that social distancing mandates are proving more successful than initially anticipated at slowing infection rates.  It will be imperative that social policies utilize all available data resources in guiding public policies moving forward.
