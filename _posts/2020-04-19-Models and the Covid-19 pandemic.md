  In this post I will explore some of the issues regarding modeling and the current Covid-19 pandemic.  I will focus on the issue
of the assumptions used, and the issues regarding public policy implementation based on the findings of the modeling.
  All information provided in this review is current as of Sunday, April 19th, 2020, and is primarily obtained from 
  healthdata.org (the IHME website), worldometers.com, statista.com, CDC.gov, and reliable news sources.
  One metric that modeling is highly concerned with is attempting to predict a peak in new cases of infection, and also daily fatalities 
  from Covid-19.  One update made on April 13th contained this interesting statement: "The duration of COVID-19 epidemic peaks appears to vary widely across locations 
  (e.g., some experience a sharp peak, while others seem to experience a flatter peak where similar peak daily COVID-19 deaths 
  occur for several days before the epidemic curve declines); this is critical to capture. Further, this development is important 
  because the timing and duration of daily death peaks informs our models on the relationship between peak and social distancing 
  covariates."
  This observation appears to mirror the apparent discrepancies in the ratio of deaths to diagnosed cases.  It also further illuminates
  one of the more difficult parts of the modeling process:  establishing a range for the parameters which the model is based upon.
  
  One parameter which was truly unknown was the ratio of expected deaths to diagnosed cases:  for every 100 people who become ill
  from the Covid-19 virus, how many would die.  Initially it was assumed that 1 to 4 people would not survive, indicating a fatal rate
  of 1%-4%.  A study from 3/31/2020 published in The Lancet reported an estimated fatal rate of 3.67%.  A quick examination of the current data reveals an even wider range of outcomes: of countries reporting over 100K diagnosed
  cases of Covid-19, the range of fatal rates is 3.1% in Germany to 13.2% in Italy.  The U.S., with a dataset over 3X that of any other country,
  is revealing a fatal rate of 5.3%.  This is based on over 750K diagnosed cases.
  
  Which leads to the question:  does the rate of fatalities accurately reflect the true fatal rate of Covid-19, or is the number of 
  undiagnosed cases potentially quite large?  This information is crucial to inform policy makers on future decisions.  If the true fatal
  rate is, for example, 2.65%, the number of undiagnosed cases in the U.S. is approximately 750K.  Depending on the distribution of
  these undiagnosed cases, easing social distancing restrictions could lead to a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.
